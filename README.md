# Matrix-Calculator-
This is a matrix calculator application based on Java. It can be used to solve several linear algebra problems
<img src="http://www.xujunqi.net/assets/Calculator.png" width="250" height="250"/>

## Problems it could solve now
- [x] Matrix addition and subtraction
- [x] Matrix multiplication
- [x] Get the Row Echelon Form and Reduced Row Echelon Form from a given matrix
- [x] Matrix solving, Ax = b  
- [x] Determinant
- [x] Markov Matrix ( which will be a subclass of Matrix.java, inheriting all of its basic method and has its own unique methods)

## More feautures
- [x] The inverse of of a given matrix
- [x] Eigenvalues of a matrix ( 2 by 2 only )

## Requirement 
- Users must have the jdk in their computers. That is the only requirement. 

## Usage 
1. Download the file "**Matrix-Calculator-Pro.jar**"
2. At this same direcotory, create a .exe/.bat/.sh file, click to edit it, paste the following line:  <br />
" java --module-path **C:\Users\xujun\Documents\lib\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib** --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,java.desktop -jar Matrix-Calculator-Pro.jar" <br />
(The part I bold is where the location of your jdk), and the other part will be the same. <br />
3. Run it!

## JUnit Test
- I provide a JUnit test to test the functionality of this matrix calculator. Feel free to comment under this repository 
if you think my tests are not comprehensive enough and more edge cases are needed.

## More information
For more information on how to run it, this youtube video may help https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGHu-SzL-5E&feature=youtu.be <br />
Really appreciate the help of the contributor of that video!
