# Matrix-Calculator-
This is a matrix calculator application based on Java. It can be used to solve several linear algebra problems
<img src="http://www.xujunqi.net/assets/Calculator.png" width="250" height="250"/>

## Problems it could solve now
- [x] Matrix addition and subtraction
- [x] Matrix multiplication
- [x] Get the Row Echelon Form and Reduced Row Echelon Form from a given matrix
- [x] Matrix solving, Ax = b  
- [x] Determinant
- [x] Markov Matrix ( which will be a subclass of Matrix.java, inheriting all of its basic method and has its own unique methods)

## More feautures
- [x] The inverse of of a given matrix
- [x] Eigenvalues of a matrix ( 2 by 2 only )

## Requirement 
- Users must have the jdk in their computers. That is the only requirement. 

## Usage 
1. Download the file
2. At the same direcotory of the **myJavaFX.jar**, create a exe or bat or sh file, click edit it, paste the following line:  <br />
" java --module-path **C:\Users\xujun\Documents\lib\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib** --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,java.desktop -jar myJavaFX.jar " <br />
(The part I bold is where the location of your jdk), and the other part will be the same. <br />
3. Run it!

## JUnit Test
- I provide a JUnit test to test the functionality of this matrix calculator,
feel free to message some more edge cases if you think my tests are not
comprehensive enough.

## More information
For more information on how to run it, this youtube video may help https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGHu-SzL-5E&feature=youtu.be <br />
Really appreciate the help of the contributor of that video!
